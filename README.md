# 42-24

A small proof-of-concept project for event invitation management, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) and [`GraphCMS`](https://app.graphcms.com).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the app, just push the latest commits to GitHub, the pre-configured connection to Vercel, which is using the [vercel adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters), will take care of the rest.
